# InfoStealer-Analyzer

üõ°Ô∏è **InfoStealer-Analyzer** is a visually professional, feature-rich, and safe simulation of info-stealer malware detection, built for cybersecurity education and portfolio demonstration. It does NOT collect any real credentials or exfiltrate data‚Äîeverything is simulated for ethical learning and awareness.

---

## üö¶ Project Overview
InfoStealer-Analyzer simulates how a real info-stealer might operate, but in a safe, defensive, and educational way. It scans for signs of info-stealer malware, suspicious processes, and common attacker behaviors, and presents the results in a modern CLI and web UI.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- **Modern Bootstrap 5 Web UI** and CLI
- **Simulated Red Team TTPs**: Process, file, and token theft detection (all simulated)
- **Threat Intelligence Mapping**: MITRE ATT&CK techniques for each scan
- **Export Results**: Download findings as JSON, CSV, or Markdown report
- **Input Sanitization**: No real data is accessed or exfiltrated
- **Secure & Clean Code**: Modular, commented, and safe for sandbox use
- **Ethical/Educational Banner**: Always visible

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Usage

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Run the CLI:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. **Run the Web UI:**
   ```bash
   python analyzer_web.py
   ```
4. **Open your browser:**
   Go to [http://127.0.0.1:5001/](http://127.0.0.1:5001/)

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### 1. Suspicious Process Scan
- Scans running processes for names or paths matching known info-stealer malware (e.g., RedLine, Raccoon, Vidar).
- **Simulated:** No real process is killed or modified.

### 2. Suspicious Directory Scan
- Looks for files with suspicious names (e.g., 'stealer', 'token', 'password') in common drop locations (user home, temp folders).
- **Simulated:** No files are deleted or exfiltrated.

### 3. Browser Data Access Scan
- Simulates detection of browser data access attempts (e.g., open handles to browser files).
- **Simulated:** No browser data is accessed.

### 4. Discord Token Theft Scan
- Simulates detection of Discord token theft attempts.
- **Simulated:** No Discord data is accessed.

### 5. Vulnerable Path Scan
- Lists world-writable or sensitive paths that could be abused by malware.
- **Simulated:** No changes are made to the system.
